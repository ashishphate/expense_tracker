#Expense Manager Console Application
##Overview
The Expense Manager is a Python-based console application designed to help users track their expenses efficiently. It provides a simple, text-based interface to add, view expenses and check monthly budget, with data persistence using a csv file. The application is ideal for users who prefer a lightweight, command-line tool for personal finance management.

##Features

Add Expense: Record a new expense with date, amount, category, and description.
View Expenses: List all recorded expenses with details.
Track Budget: Set monthly budget and verify if current month expences are over or under budget.
Save Expence: Save latest added expences to CSV file.
Data Persistence: Store expenses in a csv file for persistence between sessions.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple menu-driven navigation with input validation.

Implementation Details
The application is implemented in Python 3, utilizing standard libraries for file handling and data management. Below are the key components:
1. Data Storage

File Format: Expenses are stored in a csv file (expense.csv).
Structure: Each expense is a dictionary with fields: date, amount, category, and description.
Persistence: In filemanager.py get_data() and write_data() functions handle reading from and writing to the csv file.

2. Core Functions

Expence().add(): Prompts the user for expense details, validates inputs, and appends the expense to the list.
Expence.list(): Displays all expenses in a formatted table.
Expence.get_monthly_total(): Groups expenses by given month and year, calculating totals.
set_monthly_budget: Save limit of monthly budget.

3. User Interface

Menu: A loop displays a menu with options (1: Add Expense, 2: View Expenses, 3: Track budget, 4: Save Expense, 5: Exit).
Input Validation: Ensures valid numeric inputs for amounts and menu choices, and non-empty strings for categories and descriptions.
Error Handling: Gracefully handles file I/O errors and invalid inputs.

4. Dependencies

Standard Libraries:
csv: For reading/writing expenses to a file.
json: For reading/writing monthly budget to a file.
datetime: For handling dates.
io: For checking file existence.



5. Code Structure

Main Loop: The main() function runs the application, displaying the menu and calling appropriate functions based on user input.
Modularity: Functions are organized for specific tasks (e.g., add(), list()), ensuring maintainability.
Data Management: A list of expense dictionaries is maintained in memory, synced with the csv file.

Usage Instructions
